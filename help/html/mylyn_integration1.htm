<p>The Task List contains two types of tasks:&quot;Local Tasks&quot; and 
 shared &quot;repository tasks&quot; that are stored in a task repository 
 such as Bugzilla or Jira. See how to create new tasks. Local tasks are 
 typically contained in categories, which you can create by right-clicking 
 on the task list and selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>New</b></span> 
 | <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Category</b></span>. Repository tasks are 
 contained in special categories that represent queries.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the top of the Task List, you will find the following buttons and 
 features:</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><p>New Task - Create a new local or repository task.</p></li>
	<li><p>Synchronize - Update repository tasks with changes from the 
	 server.</p></li>
	<li><p>Task Presentation - Toggle between Scheduled and Categorized 
	 presentations.</p></li>
	<li><p>Focus on Workweek - See only tasks scheduled for this week.</p></li>
	<li><p>Find - search for a task by typing in words from the task summary</p></li>
	<li><p>Working set indicator - Indicates the currently active working 
	 set. Use the black arrow on the left to change the working set.</p></li>
	<li><p>Current task indicator - Indicates the currently active task. 
	 Use the black arrow on the left to re-activate a recently active task.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Task List Presentation</h2>
<p>The task list supports several ways to present tasks. You can toggle 
 between the following modes by using the &quot;Task Presentation&quot; 
 button in the toolbar. Categorized - View tasks grouped by their category 
 Scheduled - View tasks grouped by the &quot;scheduled date&quot; .</p>
<h3>Icon Legend and Color Coding</h3>
<p>See the legend below to interpret the icons and color coding in the 
 task list. You can view this legend by selecting &quot;Show UI Legend&quot; 
 from the menu that appears when you click the white down arrow next to 
 the minimize button in the top right corner of the Task List view.</p>
<h2>Creating new Tasks</h2>
<p>You can create new tasks by clicking on the &quot;New Task&quot; button 
 in the Task List's toolbar. This will open the &quot;New Task&quot; dialog 
 and prompt you to select a repository. There are two main types of tasks:</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><p>Local tasks</p></li>
	<li><p>Repository tasks</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Local Tasks</h3>
<p>You can use local tasks if you do not have a shared task repository 
 or if you would like to create a private personal task that is local to 
 your workspace.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To create a local task:</p>
<p>1. Select Local Task | <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Finish</b></span> 
 from the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>New Task</b></span> dialog. You 
 can then provide the following details about the task:</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><p>Task Description - Your task is called New Task by default. 
	 Replace this with a brief description of your task.</p></li>
	<li><p>Priority - Set the priority of your task. This will affect the 
	 tasks’ icon and order in the task list.</p></li>
	<li><p>Status - Set your task to &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;. 
	 In your task list, completed tasks have a strike-through font and 
	 will appear lower in the list.</p></li>
	<li><p>URL - You can associate a URL with this task.</p></li>
	<li><p>&quot;Retrieve Task Description from URL&quot; button - Set 
	 the task description to the title of the associated URL (page)</p></li>
	<li><p>&quot;Open with Web Browser&quot; button - Open the URL in the 
	 integrated web browser</p></li>
	<li><p>Scheduled For - Set the date when you will work on this task. 
	 Tasks scheduled for today or a date in the past will appear in blue 
	 in your task list. Tasks scheduled for future days will appear in 
	 black. If your task list is in focused mode, only tasks for the current 
	 week will be visible (unless they have unread changes).</p></li>
	<li><p>Due - Set the date when your task must be completed. Overdue 
	 tasks and tasks due today will appear in red in your task list.</p></li>
	<li><p>Estimated Hours - Estimate the number of hours it will take 
	 to complete this task.</p></li>
	<li><p>Active - Displays the total time that you have worked on this 
	 task. Time is only recorded when this task is active and you are actively 
	 interacting with the system.</p></li>
	<li><p>Notes - Record your personal notes about this task.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Repository Tasks</h3>
<p>You can create a new repository task when you would like to share information 
 about the task with your team using a task repository such as Bugzilla 
 or JIRA. To create a new repository task, click on the &quot;New Task&quot; 
 button in the Task List's toolbar. You can then select the repository 
 where you would like to create a task. If you don't see your team's task 
 repository, you will need to configure it in the task repositories view. 
 Once you have selected a repository, click &quot;Next&quot;. If you are 
 connecting to a Bugzilla repository, select a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Product</b></span> 
 as a top-level category for your task and click &quot;Finish&quot;. A 
 new task editor will appear.</p>
<p>If you are using Bugzilla, you can enter the following required information:</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><p>Description - Enter a brief task description in the text box 
	 at the top (this box does not have a label).</p></li>
	<li><p>Component - Specify a &quot;Component&quot; to further categorize 
	 this task within the previously selected &quot;Product&quot;.</p></li>
	<li><p>Description - Describe the task in detail. Optional</p></li>
	<li><p>You can specify additional information about your tasks in the 
	 &quot;Attributes&quot; section.</p></li>
	<li><p>Personal Planning - You can enter information in this section 
	 that will be local to your workspace and not available on your team's 
	 task repository. See Local Tasks&quot; for more information about 
	 the personal planning fields.</p></li>
	<li><p>Assigned to - Specify who should work on the task. Type the 
	 first several characters of the person's email address, and then press 
	 ctrl+space to select the address from a list. A task can be assigned 
	 to only one person at a time.</p></li>
	<li><p>Add CC - Add the addresses of people who should be notified 
	 of changes to this task. You can add multiple addresses, separated 
	 by a comma, e.g. (mik.kersten@tasktop.com, steffen.pingel@tasktop.com).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When finished, click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Submit</b></span> 
 to add your new task to your team's shared task repository.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The context tab allows you to manage the context of resources associated 
 with the task. You can view the context tab by selecting it in the lower 
 left of the editor window.</p>
<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>This section lists the resources that are part of the tasks’ context. 
 Because the number of elements may be large, you can adjust the level 
 of detail using the slider at the top of the Actions section. Sliding 
 the control all the way to the left will show you all elements in your 
 task context. As you slide it to the right, only the elements with a high 
 level of interest will be displayed. You can manually remove elements 
 from your task context by doing the following:</p>
<p>1. Right-Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Remove From Context</b></span>.</p>
<p>You may choose to view all elements and exclude irrelevant items in 
 this way before attaching the context to the task so that others can download 
 it.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>Element Detail Slider - Adjusts the minimum level of interest required 
 for an element to be displayed in the Elements section.</p>
<ul type="square">
	<li><p>Attach Context - Attaches the context to the task so that it 
	 is available for download from the shared task repository. The context 
	 consists of the elements shown on the right.</p></li>
	<li><p>Retrieve Context - Replaces the current task context with one 
	 that is attached to the task in the shared task repository.</p></li>
	<li><p>Copy Context to... - Copy the task context to another task. 
	 That task will then have the same context as the current task.</p></li>
	<li><p>Clear Context - Removes all context information from the task.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Use the planning tab to access local information about the task that 
 is private to your workspace. You can view the planning tab by selecting 
 it in the lower left of the editor window. This tab contains a large area 
 where you can enter personal notes about the task. See the local task 
 section for more information about fields in the Personal Planning section.</p>
<h2>Task-Focused Interface</h2>
<p>The task-focused interface is oriented around tasks and offers several 
 ways to focus the interface on only what is relevant for the currently 
 active task. You can focus navigator views (e.g. Package Explorer, Project 
 Explorer, Navigator) by toggling the &quot;Focus on Active Task&quot; 
 button in the toolbar. When focused, the view will show only the resources 
 that are &quot;interesting&quot; for the currently active task.</p>
<p>Alt+Click Navigation</p>
<p>To navigate to a new resource that is not a part of the active task's 
 context, you can toggle &quot;Focus on Active Task&quot; off, browse to 
 the resource, and then click &quot;Focus on Active Task&quot; again to 
 see only relevant resources. A more efficient way to add new resources 
 is to use Alt+Click navigation (Clicking the mouse while holding the Alt 
 key). When a view is in Focused mode, you can Alt+Click a node to temporarily 
 show all of its children. Once an element that was previously not interesting 
 is selected with the mouse, it becomes interesting the other child elements 
 will disappear. The clicked element is now a part of the task's context. 
 Alt can be held down while clicking to drill down from a top-level element 
 to a deeply nested element that is to be added to the task context. Multiple 
 Alt+Click are supported so that you can add several elements to the task 
 context. As soon as a normal click is made, uninteresting elements will 
 disappear. Ctrl+Click (i.e. disjoint selections, use Command key on Mac) 
 are also supported and will cause each element clicked to become interesting. 
 The first normal click will cause uninteresting elements to disappear. 
 Note that Ctrl+click elements will become interesting (turn from gray 
 to black) but only the most recently-clicked one will be selected while 
 Alt is held down. Focusing Editors</p>
<p>Some editors such as the Java editor support focusing. Clicking the 
 Focus button in the toolbar will fold all declarations that are not part 
 of the active task context.</p>
<h3>Task-focused Ordering</h3>
<p>When a task is active, elements that are interesting are displayed more 
 prominently. For example, when you open the Java Open Type dialog (Ctrl+Shift+T), 
 types that are interesting for the active task are shown first. Similarly, 
 when you use ctrl+space to autocomplete a method name in a Java source 
 file, methods that are in the task context are displayed at the top. Working 
 Set Integration</p>
<p>When Focus is applied to a navigator view, the working sets filter for 
 that navigator view will be disabled. This ensures that you see all interesting 
 elements when working on a task that spans working sets. To enforce visibility 
 of only elements within one working set, do the following: Set the view 
 to show working sets as top-level elements. Use the Go Into action on 
 the popup menu of the working set node in the view to scope the view down 
 to just the working set. Open Task dialog</p>
<p>An Open Type style dialog is available for opening tasks (Ctrl+F12) 
 and for activating tasks (Ctrl+F9). The list is initially populated by 
 recently active tasks. The active task can also be deactivated via Ctrl+Shift+F9. 
 This can be used as a keyboard-only alternative for multi-tasking without 
 the Task List view visible. These actions appear in the Navigate menu.</p>
<h3>Task Hyperlinking</h3>
<p>In the task editor, comments that include text of the form bug#123 or 
 task#123 or bug 123 will be hyperlinked. Ctrl+clicking on this text will 
 open the task or bug in the rich task editor. To support hyperlinks within 
 other text editors such as code or .txt files, the project that contains 
 the file must be associated with a particular task repository. This is 
 configured by right-clicking on the project and navigating to &quot;Properties&quot; 
 &gt; &quot;Task Repository&quot; and selecting the task repository used 
 when working with this project. Reporting Bugs from the Error Log</p>
<p>Bugs can created directly from events in the Error Log view. This will 
 create a new repository task editor with the summary and description populated 
 with the error event's details. If the Connector you are using does not 
 have a rich editor, the event details will be placed into the clipboard 
 so that you can paste them into the web-based editor that will be opened 
 automatically.</p>
